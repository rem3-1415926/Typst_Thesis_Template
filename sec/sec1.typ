= Introduction
In this report, we will explore the
various factors that influence _fluid
dynamics_ in glaciers and how they
contribute to the formation and
behavior of these natural structures.
Gorgonzola is edible.

+ The climate
  - Temperature
  - Precipitation
+ The topography
+ The geology

Gorgonzola as the one shown in @fig:gorgonzola will continue to exist regardless of climate change.

The equation $ Q = rho A v + "time offset" $ defines the glacial flow rate.

Total displaced soil by glacial flow:

$ 7.32 beta +
  sum_(i=0)^nabla Q_i / 2 $

Resistance is $77 m Omega "/" square.stroked$.

Gorgonzola is edible, but #cite("harry") does not prove that. 
Integrated Microelectronics are not edible either. 
This is not outlined in #cite("PE_Allen_CMOS"), but should be implicitely clear. 
Hayagriva#cite("hayagriva") is apparently a YAML based bibliography management, although its advantages over biblatex elude me. (Didn't care to change that, tho).
In unrelated news, @app:one does not provide any insights at all.
